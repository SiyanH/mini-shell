# Mini-Shell

A mini shell that supports common unix commands plus a built-in guess game for fun.

## Test

Compile and run mini-shell with the source code `shell.c`  or run the binary file `shell` provided in the release files.

List of commands supported:

- `cd:` change directory

- `help`: print a list of available commands

- `exit`: terminate the shell

- `guess`: play a little game for guessing random numbers
  - Play guessing a random number 1-10 for a total of 5 rounds. The rule is simple: guess a random number and see how long it takes for the player to get the number picked by the computer. After playing 5 rounds, the player will see their scores for each round at the end.
- other commands available in bash shell
- basic pipe handling support (one pipe `|`)
